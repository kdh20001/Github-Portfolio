            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>I am a dedicated computer science student nearing the completion of my associate degree at Chattanooga State Community College. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages including C#, Java, and Python, as well as a deep understanding of code structure, syntax, and computer systems. I am currently pursuing CompTIA A+ certification, with plans to follow up with Network+ and Security+ to further strengthen my technical credentials.</p>
            
            <p>Education & Technical Skills: <br>Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science—from binary systems to object-oriented programming. I particularly enjoy collaborative projects that challenge me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. Advanced mathematics, including Calculus II and upcoming physics courses, has significantly enhanced my logical thinking and coding capabilities. My long-term goal is to earn a Master’s degree in Computer Science and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
            
            <p>Professional Experience: <br>As the Barista Manager at Frothy Monkey Chattanooga, I lead a team of skilled baristas with a focus on quality control, inventory management, training, and customer service. I take pride in fostering a supportive and knowledgeable team environment. When I transition into the tech field, I will ensure a smooth handoff to my assistant lead barista, leaving the team in capable hands.</p>
            
            <p>Home Lab & Technical Projects: <br>Technology has fascinated me since childhood. I maintain a personal home lab where I repair and repurpose electronics, transforming outdated devices into functional tools—such as converting old laptops into media centers or using spare routers as Wi-Fi extenders. I’ve built a personal cloud using salvaged HDDs and SSDs, and I regularly assist friends and family with troubleshooting and repairs. My philosophy is simple: “If you can’t fix it, you don’t own it.”</p>
            
            <p>Game Development & Digital Design: <br>I am the sole developer behind Scrungus1471, a sci-fi fantasy RPG that began as a passion project in May 2024. Since its inception, I’ve built a robust game system featuring:

Inventory and merchant systems
Custom behavior trees for six unique enemy types
One boss enemy and six interactive NPCs
Melee and ranged combat mechanics
Interchangeable armor and equipment
Six distinct game areas with persistent data systems

Currently, I am finalizing a playable introduction mission and preparing for a beta release on Steam. This project showcases my skills in 3D modeling, animation, programming, and storytelling—all driven by a desire to create immersive digital experiences.</p>
